These are lightly edited notes from a reading group hosted by the
#link("https://0xparc.org", "0xPARC Foundation").
It's not meant to be a mathematically complete reference,
but rather a introduction to the general landscape and ideas for newcomers.

- Modular arithmetic is assumed, and $FF_q$ denotes the field field with $q$ elements.
- Group law on an elliptic curve is assumed, but not much more than that.
- You should know what a one-way hash function is (like SHA-256).
