These are notes from a reading group hosted by the 0xPARC Foundation.
It's not meant to be a mathematically complete reference,
but rather a set of short write-ups that give a blog-post level of understanding
of a collection of loosely related topics
that one could use to get a sense of the landscape.
In other words, it's meant to be a light introduction to the topics in a
unified format rather than a textbook.
