= Introduction to zkSNARKs

Peggy has done some very difficult calculation.
She wants to prove to Victor that she did it.
Victor wants to check that Peggy did it, but he 
is too lazy to redo the whole calculation himself.

- Maybe Peggy wants to keep part of the calculation secret.
  Maybe her calculation was "find a solution to this puzzle,"
  and she wants to prove that she found a solution 
  without saying what the solution is.
- Maybe it's just a really long, annoying calculation,
  and Victor doesn't have the energy to check it all line-by-line.
